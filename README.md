Estimation of causal effect using machine learning methods
Observational medical databases increasingly find uses for comparative effectiveness and safety research. However, the lack of analytic methods that simultaneously handle the issues of missing data and confounding bias along with the onus of model specification, limit the use of these valuable data sources. We derived a novel machine-learning approach based on trees to estimate the average treatment effect.
